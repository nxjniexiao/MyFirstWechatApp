    content: '“The energy transition is undeniable,” says Remi Eriksen, Group President and CEO of DNV GL. “Last year, more gigawatts of renewable energy were added than those from fossil fuels and this is reflected in where lenders are putting their money.”\n\nFollowing on from the 2017 report, the new Maritime Forecast to 2050 focusses on the challenges of decarbonizing the shipping industry. It examines recent changes in shipping activity and fuel consumption, future developments in the types and levels of cargoes transported, and future regulations, fuels and technology drivers.\n\n“Decarbonization will be one of the megatrends that will shape the maritime industry over the next decades, especially in light of the new IMO greenhouse gas strategy,” says Knut ?rbeck-Nilssen, CEO DNV GL – Maritime. “Combined with the current and future trends in technology and regulations, this means that investment decisions should be examined through a new lens. Therefore, we propose a ‘carbon robust’ approach, which looks at future CO2 regulations and requirements and emphasizes flexibility, safety, and long term competitiveness. With this new framework, we hope to help empower robust decision making on assets.”\n\nIn the first Maritime Forecast, DNV GL introduced the concept of the “carbon robust” ship. The 2018 Forecast develops this concept with a new model that now evaluates fuel and technology options by comparing the break-even costs of a design to that of the competing fleet of ships. This aims to support maritime stakeholders in evaluating the long-term competitiveness of their vessels and fleet and to future-proof their assets.\n\nA case study utilizing the model in several vessel designs reveals some striking findings, including that investing in energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint beyond existing standards can increase the competitiveness of a vessel over its lifetime. The study also suggests that owners of high-emitting vessels could be exposed to significant market risks in 2030 and 2040. \n\n“The uncertainty confronting the maritime industry in increasing as we head towards 2050. This makes it more important than ever before to examine the regulatory and technological challenges and opportunities of future scenarios to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the existing fleet and newbuildings,” said Knut ?rbeck-Nilssen. \n\nThe Maritime Forecast predicts a rise of nearly a third (32%) in seaborne-trade measured in tonne-miles for 2016–2030, but only 5% growth over the period 2030–2050. This is based on the results of DNV GL’s updated global model, which is described in detail in the DNV GL Energy Transition Outlook 2018. The model encompasses the global energy supply and demand, and the use and exchange of energy within and between ten world regions.',

    content: 'By providing freely accessible tools for visualising and analysing comprehensive and high-quality data, supplemented by an extensive collection of technical resources, AFI helps ship owners and other maritime stakeholders monitor the global uptake of alternative fuels and assess the best options for their own vessels.\n\nThe decision of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to limit fuel sulphur content from 1 January 2020, and the recently adopted ambition to halve GHG emission by 2050 mean the world’s future fleet will have to rely on a broader range of fuels and adopt novel propulsion solutions and energy efficiency measures. \n\nAll alternative fuel options are accompanied by benefits and challenges. Prerequisites for introducing a new fuel include availability of sufficient production and distribution facilities as well as an adequate bunkering infrastructure. In addition, new fuels in many cases require extensive on-board modifications, which brings complexity and cost. \n\nDNV GL developed the Alternative Fuel Insight (AFI) platform to support the shipping industry’s transition to a cleaner, green future. It provides a complete overview on developments of alternative fuels and technologies, covering both investments on ships and in bunkering infrastructure.  \n\nA core aim is to improve clarity for a range of stakeholders allowing them to make informed decisions. It will assist ship owners select a fuel for the vessels they order today and in coming years, and fuel suppliers weighing up investment in new bunkering infrastructure. Maritime authorities will benefit from increased transparency, while equipment suppliers can gather intelligence for product development strategies. \n\nBecause the maritime fuel landscape is continually evolving, AFI is not a static platform. To encourage industry collaboration, and to ensure the information presented on AFI is up to the minute, users can submit updates on the status of existing bunkering projects for alternative fuels or share details of new ones.',
